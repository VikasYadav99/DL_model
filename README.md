# DL_model

This notebook is written in google colab

## Dataset
Dataset is a set of signals taken from different subjects' (human bodies) different parts like scalp, chest, ear and eyes. 
These signals are used to identify the sleep stage, in which the subject is while sleeping.

## Significance
It helps to diagnose mental health


## What this notebook does?
Clones the below mentioned github repository that has the implementation of deepsleepnet model.
Visualizes the signals in time as well as frequency domain.
Uses fast fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to get the frequency domain of signal in time domain.
Uses the technique of fourier transform for implementing a bandpass filter for signals.
Visualizes the actual output and predicted output of model.
